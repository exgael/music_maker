# Music Composition Project

This project contains several Python scripts that generate different musical compositions using synthetic instruments.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-composition-project.git
   cd music-composition-project
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv music_env
   source music_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `music_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Compositions

After setting up the environment, you can run any of the song scripts using Python. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.

### Song 1
```
python song1.py
```

### Song 2
```
python song2.py
```

### Song 3
```
python song3.py
```

### Megalovania
```
python megalovania.py
```

Each script will generate and play the composition. The audio will play through your default audio output device.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any audio playback issues, ensure your system's audio is not muted and the volume is turned up.
- On some systems, you may need to install additional audio drivers or libraries. Refer to the `simpleaudio` documentation for system-specific requirements.

## Modifying the Compositions

Feel free to open the Python files and experiment with the compositions. You can modify notes, durations, instruments, or add new elements to create your own unique sounds!
